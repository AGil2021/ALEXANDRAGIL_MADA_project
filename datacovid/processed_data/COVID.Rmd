This section of the project is the exploratory data analysis (EDA). It will be save at processed_data as Rdm file, as COVID.


#load needed packages.
```{r}

install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(dplyr) #for data processing
library(here) #to set paths
library(tidyverse)
```

#Path to data
```{r}
data_location <- here::here("datacovid","raw_data","Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age.csv")
rawdata <- read.csv(data_location)
```
# What is in my dataset?
```{r}

```
# Cleaning the dataset
The study is focus in Georgia 
```{r}
GA<-rawdata %>%
        filter(State=="Georgia",Group=="By Total", !Sex=="All Sexes")%>%
        select(-"Data.As.Of", -"Group", -"Year", -"Month", -"Footnote")
GA
```
#Save GA data 
```{r}
# The data will be saved as rds

# Data location 
save_data_location <- here::here("datacovid", "processed_data","GA.rds")

saveRDS(GA, file = save_data_location )
```
# Join datasets
```{r}
# now it time to join the dataset 2, which shows the comorbidites

#load data set about comorbities
data_location<- here::here("datacovid", "raw_data","comorbidities.csv" )
comorbidities <- read.csv(data_location)
#rename the column name "sex" in comorbidities dataset for "Sex"
colnames(comorbidities)[colnames(comorbidities)=="sex"]<-"Sex"

# The data will be join by sex
jdata<- left_join(GA , comorbidities, by="Sex" )

View(jdata)
```
#Dr Handel, can you give me some advise about the better way to joint those data sets?
