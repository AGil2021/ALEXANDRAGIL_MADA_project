This section of the project is the exploratory data analysis (EDA). It will be save at processed_data as Rdm file, as COVID.

# Filter Data
#The maximum values are too large in comparison with the median that corresponds to 50% of the data, which generally oscillates around 0, for this reason, for a better visualization, a cut-off point was taken to filter the data
```{r}
newdata<- rawdata%>%
          filter(`COVID.19.Deaths`< 400)
newdata
glimpse(newdata)

```
#Plots and Tables
```{r}
bp <- ggplot(newdata, aes( x = `COVID.19.Deaths`)) + geom_histogram()

bp

histo <- ggplot(newdata, aes( x = `COVID.19.Deaths`)) + geom_histogram()+
        facet_grid(Sex ~ .)

bp1 <- ggplot(newdata, aes(x=`Pneumonia.Deaths`)) + geom_histogram()

bp1

#Model
```{r}
fit <- lm(`COVID.19.Deaths`~ Sex+`Age.Group`+State + Year , data=newdata )

summary(fit)

plot(fit)

```
#Since the values of Covid-19 deaths,Pneumonia Deaths, and Influenza Deaths are close to zero, is necessary orienting the study by age and sex.

#Save GA data
