The structure below is a possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed.


# Summary/Abstract



# Introduction 

## General Background Information
COVID-19 and Influenza are both contagious respiratory illnesses, meaning they affect lungs and breathing. Therefore, Pneumonia is a concern between medical community, as a result of  getting positive result for COVID-19 and/or influenza. This study will analyze COVID-19 deaths and its relationship with Pneumonia and Influenza.


## Description of data and data source
The data set that will be used is Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age (CDC data updated October 6, 2021). The dataset shows the deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pneumonia, and influenza reported to NCHS by sex, age group, and jurisdiction of occurrence.
## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
The main idea was analyzed the mortality due to COVID-19 and its relationship with Pneumonia and Influenza in adults over 25 years old.

# Methods and Results
At the begging of the analysis the main idea was analyzed the mortality due to COVID-19 and its relationship with Pneumonia and Influenza using the entire population of the data set, including population between 0 -17 years old. However, due to the excessive amount of missing values, the data set was limited to adults over 25 years old.

## Data import and cleaning
The raw data was found at CDC website. This data was cleaned using filters to remove the group of age that weren't used, the data set that was used for the analysis is call newdata. 
```{r}
data_location <- here::here("datacovid","raw_data","Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age.csv")


rawdata <- read.csv(data_location)

col_types = cols(Year = col_factor(), 
Month = col_character(), 
Footnote = col_character())

newdata <- rawdata %>% filter(!Sex == "All Sexes")


newdata <- newdata %>% filter(!Age.Group == "All Ages" & !Age.Group == "Under 1 year" & !Age.Group== "0-17 years" &  !Age.Group == "1-4 years"  & !Age.Group == "1-4 years" & !Age.Group == "15-24 years" &!Age.Group == "5-14 years" & !Age.Group == "18-29 years" )


newdata <- newdata %>% filter(Group == "By Year")

newdata <- newdata %>% filter(!COVID.19.Deaths == "NA")

newdata <- newdata %>% filter(!COVID.19.Deaths == 0)

#newdata <- newdata %>% filter(!State == "United States")

newdata <- newdata %>% filter(COVID.19.Deaths >1000)

glimpse(newdata)
```


## Exploratory analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. You should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. FIgures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data._

_Continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables. Plots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones._

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. t-tests, simple regression model with 1 predictor, etc.) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._

Table \@ref(tab:summarytable) shows a table summarizing the data.


```{r summarytable,  echo=FALSE}
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Data summary table.')
```


Figure \@ref(fig:resultfigure) shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r resultfigure,  fig.cap='Analysis figure.', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../results/resultfigure.png")
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example table \@ref(tab:resulttable) shows a table summarizing a linear model fit.

```{r resulttable,  echo=FALSE}
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/resulttable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Linear model fit table.')
```


# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
Mortality due to COVID-19 are conditioning to age and sex. There is a strong relationship between COVID-19 mortality and Pneumonia.

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@Leek2015a] discusses types of analyses. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
